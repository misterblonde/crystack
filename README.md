# crystack

A Python module to analyse the intermolecular interactions across an organic
molecular material. This code was written as part of my PhD thesis and the
crystal interactions module.

This repo is structured as follows:

The entire ```crystack``` analysis for a relevant molecular crystal is run via
modifying the automation script: ```run_analysis_for_crystal.sh```


Raw Molecular Data: ```data/```
Residuals files of Molecular Crystals: ```res/```
Preliminary results plots: ```Figures/```
